        Welcome to SonicPredict, which is a small Flask web app I built to serve my fitted machine learning
        model from the 2020 SPWLA PDDA Machine Learning Contest. The competition took place between March-May 2020 
        with a total of 31 teams participating. The goal of the competition was to predict P- and S-sonic well 
        logs using other commonly acquired well logs. This is a problem that arises commonly in the oil & gas 
        industry, either as a result of budget constraints, poor borehole conditions, or sometimes the data 
        is simply missing.

        Each team was given the same training data set from which to build novel machine learning solutions. 
        Additionally, we were given a 20% sample of the blind test data with which to test our model accuracy. 
        The ultimate goal was to minimize the combined RMSE of both predicted logs (DTC & DTS). The winner 
        of the competition was the team whose final submission resulted in the lowest RMSE when tested on 
        the full blind test data. The data comes from Equinor's 
        <a href="https://www.equinor.com/en/how-and-why/digitalisation-in-our-dna/volve-field-data-village-download.html" target="_blank">Volve</a> 
        field which was open-sourced in 2018.

        The training data consisted of the following well logs:
        <ul>
            <li>Caliper (Cal)</li>
            <li>Gamma Ray (GR)</li>
            <li>Medium Resistivity (HRM)</li>
            <li>Deep Resistivity (HRD)</li>
            <li>Porosity (CNC)</li>
            <li>Density (ZDEN)</li>
            <li>Photoelectric Factor (PE)</li>
            <li>P-Sonic (DTC)</li>
            <li>S-Sonic (DTS)</li>
        </ul>
        and the targets were both P- and S-sonic logs. My final model used GR, HRD, CNC, & ZDEN, and consisted of 
        and average ensemble of a Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, XGBoost, Principal Component Regression, 
        & KNN Regression. This model achieved an RMSE of 16.31 and finished 9<sup>th</sup> of the 20 teams which were ranked. 
        The top team achieved an RMSE of 12.36.
